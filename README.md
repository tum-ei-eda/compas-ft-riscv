COMPAS: Compiler-assisted Software-implemented Hardware Fault Tolerance implemented in LLVM passes for the RISC-V backend

Repo to house SIHFT passes for LLVM to create COMPAS, a compiler that adds fault tolerance on instruction level for RISCV 32/64 targets.
COMPAS is implemented such that it can be used as patch for the RISC-V LLVM toolchain.

## User Guide
Detailed instructions on compiler installation and usage can be found in `doc/manual`. We provide the manual as pdf.

<!--
After cloning the repo, generate the user manual in `doc/manual` using latex compiler. For example, we used [`latexmk`](https://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html) utitlity to generate the manual pdf in some build location using
```shell
$ latexmk -pdf doc/manual/main.tex -outdir=build/
```
-->

The manual provides details on how to install LLVM compiler with our SIHFT passes. Further, the manual provides usage instructions on how to harden a given C/C++ project using SIHFT transformations.
